                    <p>The Government Research (GRIS) ID is a unique identifier that will be allocated to all new studies (even if they are sub-studies) when it is first logged in a system.</p>
                    <p>
                        The GRIS ID will be generated by the person who first creates the study record. This could be in a Local Portfolio Management System (LPMS), funding system, or regulatory and ethics approval system.
                        Whilst the GRIS ID could be generated by an R&D Team. Sponsor, Research Study team memeber or someone associated with the research study team, it will be the responsibility of the Chief Investigator to share this GRIS ID with research study team members.
